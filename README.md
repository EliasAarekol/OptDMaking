### TODO

 - Look at solvers structure, right now you need a new object for each node which sucks
 - Don't know if rewards from gym models should be positive or negative
 - Implement gym mode properly so that can use gymnasium.make
 - implement stochastic policy - need soluition pool
 - solution pool for solvers
 - implement advantage table
 - implement training
 - implement experience buffer
 - rethink and restructure solvers
 - proper seeding in gymnasium reset
 - check intensity calculations (sanity check)
